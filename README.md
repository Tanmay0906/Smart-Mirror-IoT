# Smart Mirror – A Real-Time Indoor Information System

## 📌 Overview
Smart Mirror is an IoT-based indoor information system designed to monitor and display real-time
environmental conditions. The system focuses on **information visualization and comfort awareness**
rather than direct appliance control, making it safe, reliable, and suitable for academic and real-world use.

It displays indoor temperature, humidity, time, and comfort status using both a local LCD display
and a web-based dashboard.
